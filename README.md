## Welcome to AutoGen Documentation!

AutoGen, also known as "Automated Program Generator", is a highly sophisticated tool designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitive text.

In its simplest form, it is a powerful macro processor with abilities to run shell commands and use the output in the generation process. It can also perform conditional processing and load custom scripts to further extend its capabilities.

# How does AutoGen Work?

**Step 1:** AutoGen begins by taking the template files and a definitions file as input. A "definitions file" contain variables that will be substituted into the template file during processing.

**Step 2:** The template files contain text and AutoGen-specific markup. These templates are then processed against the definitions file, to create the target output files.

**Step 3:** In the processing phase, the markup is interpreted by AutoGen to control how the output files are generated.

**Step 4:** AutoGen identifies the points in the template file where it should insert variances, which are provided by the definitions file.

**Step 5:** It can insert the variances as simple text replacements or as snippets of code, depending on what is required by your target output files.

The system essentially separates programming code from the resultant program content and allows large volumes of unique and complex code to be manipulated by a simple, highly-readable data file. The ultimate advantage of autogen lies in its ability to generate complex code structures with the help of less and easy-to-maintain code.

## Example:

Let's assume we have a definitions file (def-file) storing different types of fruits, and we want to create a Python script that prints the names of all the fruits. In this setup, our def-file would list all the fruits, while our autogen template would contain the Python code structure. Autogen takes the two as inputs and processes, thus inserting the names of fruits listed in the def-file into the Python script, thereby generating the final Python script.

Enjoy using AutoGen!
